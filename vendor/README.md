Place the local PDF libraries in this folder so the Generate PDF button can work offline and match the on-page preview.

Required files (copied from your downloaded ZIP or other trusted sources):
1) html2canvas.min.js
2) jspdf.umd.min.js

After adding both files here, reload the page and click Generate PDF. The app will use these local scripts; if they’re missing, it will fall back to the browser print dialog.
